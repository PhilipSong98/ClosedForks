## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**🔄 Session Issues After Signup/Login**
- **Cause**: Conflicting cookies from multiple Supabase projects
- **Fix**: Clear all cookies for localhost:3000:
  1. Open DevTools (F12) → Application tab
  2. Storage → Cookies → localhost:3000
  3. Right-click → Clear or delete all cookies
  4. Refresh and try to sign in again

**❌ Invite Code Not Working**
- **Cause**: Code may be expired or usage limit reached
- **Fix**: Use the test code `123456` or contact admin for a new code

**⏱️ Profile Fetch Timeout**
- **Cause**: Database connectivity or RLS policy issues
- **Fix**: App automatically uses fallback data - no action needed

**🔑 Session Not Persisting Across Reloads**
- **Cause**: Cookie configuration problems
- **Fix**: Check that `@supabase/ssr` is properly configured

### Development Issues

**📦 Build Failures**
```bash
npm run build      # Will show TypeScript errors during build
npm run lint       # Check linting issues
```

**🔌 Database Connection Issues**
- Verify `.env.local` variables are set correctly
- Check Supabase project is active and accessible
- Review RLS policies in Supabase dashboard

**🗺️ Google Places Not Working**
- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY` is set
- Check API key has Places API enabled
- Verify billing is set up for Google Cloud project

**📱 Duplicate Popups Appearing**
- **Cause**: Both mobile Sheet and desktop Dialog rendering simultaneously
- **Fix**: Implemented conditional rendering with `useMediaQuery` hook
- **Prevention**: Use either Sheet OR Dialog based on screen size, never both

### Adding New Components

```bash
# Add shadcn/ui components
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]

# Example: Add a new form component

```

### Database Changes

2. Run the new SQL in your Supabase project
3. Update TypeScript types in `types/index.ts`
4. Update validation schemas in `lib/validations/index.ts`

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run build        # Check TypeScript types during build

# Database
